# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Provide a syntactic sugar to automatically implement a given trait `Tr` using a pre-existing type implementing `Tr`. The purpose is to improve code reuse in rust without damaging the orthogonality of already existing concepts or adding new ones.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Let's consider some existing pieces of code:
```rust
// from rust/src/test/run-pass/dropck_legal_cycles.rs
impl<'a> Hash for H<'a> {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
        self.name.hash(state)
    }
}
```
```rust
// from servo/components/devtools/actors/timeline.rs
impl Encodable for HighResolutionStamp {
    fn encode<S: Encoder>(&self, s: &mut S) -> Result<(), S::Error> {
        self.0.encode(s)
    }
}
```
We can see a recurring pattern where the implementation of a method only consists in applying the same method to a subfield or more generally to an expression containing `self`. Those are examples of the well known [composition pattern][object_composition]. It has a lot of advantages but unfortunately it also implies writing explicit boilerplate code again and again. In a classical oop language we could also have opted for inheritance for similar cases. Inheritance comes with its own bunch of problems and limitations but at least it allows a straightforward form of code reuse: any subclass implicitly imports the public methods of its superclass(es).

Rust has no inheritance (yet) and as a result composition is an even more interesting pattern for factoring code than in other languages. In fact it is already used in many places. Some (approximate) figures:

Project           | Occurences of "delegating methods" |
------------------| ---------------------------------- |
rust-lang/rust    | 845                                |
rust-lang/cargo   | 38                                 |
servo/servo       | 314                                |

It would be an improvement if we alleviated the composition pattern so that it can remain/become a privileged tool for code reuse while being as terse as the inheritance-based equivalent. Related discussions:

## Syntax example

Let's add a syntactic sugar so that the examples above become:
```rust
impl<'a> Hash for H<'a> use self.name;
```
and
```rust
impl Encodable for HighResolutionStamp use self.0;
```

Again this feature adds no new concept. It just simplifies an existing code pattern. However it is interesting to understand the similarities and differences with inheritance. The *delegating type* (`H<'a>` in the first example) implicitely "inherits" methods (`hash`) of the *delegated trait* (`Hash`) from the *surrogate type* (`&'static str` which is the type of the *delegating expression* `self.name`) like a subclass inherits methods from its superclass(es). A fundamental difference is that the delegating type is not a subtype of the surrogate type in the sense of Liskov. There is no external link between the types. The surrogate may even be less visible than the delegating type. Another difference is that the developer has a total control on which part of the surrogate type to reuse whereas class hierarchy forces him/her to import the entire public interface of the superclass (this is because a superclass plays two roles: the role of the surrogate type and the role of the delegated trait).

## Partial delegation 

If we consider this piece of code:
```rust
// from rust/src/libsyntax/attr.rs
impl AttrMetaMethods for Attribute {
    fn check_name(&self, name: &str) -> bool {
        let matches = name == &self.name()[..];
        if matches {
            mark_used(self);
        }
        matches
    }
    fn name(&self) -> InternedString { self.meta().name() }
    fn value_str(&self) -> Option<InternedString> {
        self.meta().value_str()
    }
    fn meta_item_list(&self) -> Option<&[P<MetaItem>]> {
        self.node.value.meta_item_list()
    }
    fn span(&self) -> Span { self.meta().span }
}
```
we can identify the recurring expression `self.meta()` but 2 of the 5 methods are more complex. This heterogeneity can be handled simply if we allow partial delegation like in
```rust
impl AttrMetaMethods for Attribute use self.meta() {
    fn check_name(&self, name: &str) -> bool {
        let matches = name == &self.name()[..];
        if matches {
            mark_used(self);
        }
        matches
    }
    fn meta_item_list(&self) -> Option<&[P<MetaItem>]> {
        self.node.value.meta_item_list()
    }
}
```
Only missing methods are automatically implemented.

In some other cases the compiler just cannot generate the appropriate method. For example when `self` is moved rather than borrowed, unless the delegating expression produces a result that can itself be moved the borrow checker will complain. In that kind of situations the developer can again provide a custom implementation where necessary and let the compiler handle the rest of the methods.

## Delegation for other parameters 

If `Self` is used for other parameters, everything works nicely and no specific treatment is required.
```rust
// from rust/src/libcollections/btree/map.rs
impl<K: PartialOrd, V: PartialOrd> PartialOrd for BTreeMap<K, V> {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &BTreeMap<K, V>) -> Option<Ordering> {
        self.iter().partial_cmp(other.iter())
    }
}
```
becomes 
```rust
impl<K: PartialOrd, V: PartialOrd> PartialOrd for BTreeMap<K, V> use self.iter();
```

## Associated types/constants 

Unless explicitly set associated types and constants should default to the surrogate implementation value of the corresponding items.

## Types and delegation

All the examples above deal with structs and delegation to subfields. However no restriction is required. Delegating types and surrogates types might be of any kind (structs, tuples, enums, arrays, lambdas, ...) provided it makes sense. An illustrative example with enums:
```rust
enum HTMLColor { White, Silver, Gray, Black,
	Red, Maroon, Yellow, Olive,
	Lime, Green, Aqua, Teal,
	Blue, Navy, Fuchsia, Purple };

impl Coordinates for HTMLColor {
	fn get_red(&self) -> f32 { ... }
	fn get_green(&self) -> f32 { ... }
	fn get_blue(&self) -> f32 { ... }
	fn get_hue(&self) -> f32 { ... }
	fn get_saturation(&self) -> f32 { ... }
	fn get_brightness(&self) -> f32 { ... }
}

enum ThreeBitColor { Black, Blue, Green, Cyan,
	Red, Magenta, Yellow, White };

fn to_html_color(color: &ThreeBitColor) -> HTMLColor { ... }

impl Coordinates for ThreeBitColor use to_html_color(&self);
```

## Possible extensions

### Inverse delegating expressions

Can we handle cases as this one
```rust
// from servo/components/layout/block.rs
impl<T: Clone> Clone for BinaryHeap<T> {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        BinaryHeap { data: self.data.clone() }
    }

    fn clone_from(&mut self, source: &Self) {
        self.data.clone_from(&source.data);
    }
}
```
where `Self` is used as a return type? Yes but we need a second expression for that.
```rust
impl<T: Clone> Clone for BinaryHeap<T> use self.data, BinaryHeap { data: super };
```
Here the `super` keyword corresponds to an instance of the surrogate type. It is the symmetric of `self`. The whole expression must have type `Self`. Both direct and inverse delegating expressions may be given at the same time or possibly just one of them if only one conversion is needed.

### Combined delegation

It would be nice if delegation could be combined for multiple traits so that
```rust
// from cargo/src/cargo/core/package_id.rs 
impl PartialEq for PackageId {
    fn eq(&self, other: &PackageId) -> bool {
        (*self.inner).eq(&*other.inner)
    }
}
impl PartialOrd for PackageId {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &PackageId) -> Option<Ordering> {
        (*self.inner).partial_cmp(&*other.inner)
    }
}
impl Ord for PackageId {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &PackageId) -> Ordering {
        (*self.inner).cmp(&*other.inner)
    }
}
```
could be reduced to the single line
```rust
impl PartialEq + PartialOrd + Ord for PackageId use &*self.inner;
```

### Function-based delegation

Sometimes implementations are trait-free but the same pattern is found like in
```rust
// from rust/src/librustc/middle/mem_categorization.rs
impl<'t, 'a,'tcx> MemCategorizationContext<'t, 'a, 'tcx> {
    
    â€¦
    
    fn node_ty(&self, id: ast::NodeId) -> McResult<Ty<'tcx>> {
        self.typer.node_ty(id)
    }
}
```
Here we have no trait to delegate but the same method signatures are reused and semantically the situation is close to a trait-based implementation. A simple possibility could be to introduce a new trait. An alternative is to allow delegation at method level.
```rust
impl<'t, 'a,'tcx> fn node_ty for MemCategorizationContext<'t, 'a, 'tcx> use self.typer;
```

### More complex delegation

`Self` can also appear inside more complex parameter/result types like `Option<Self>`, `Box<Self>` or `&[Self]`. If we had HKT in Rust a partial solution based on [functor types][functors] might have been possible. It could still be possible to handle specific cases like precisely the ones above but the complexity might not be worth the benefit.

### Value-dependent surrogate type

Let's consider a new example:
```rust
enum TextBoxContent { Number(f64), String(Str) }

// how to delegate?
impl Hash for TextBoxContent use ??? ;
```
It seems that in theory we should be able to delegate meaningfully given that for any value of `TextBoxContent` there is an obvious existing implementation for `Hash`. The problem is we cannot select a **single** surrogate type. The actual surrogate type should indeed be chosen based on the runtime value of `Self`. To handle this case I slightly modify the delegation syntax by using a variation of blaenk's proposition: `impl Tr for B use delegatingExpression.impl;`. Now this new syntax could be extended to solve our current issue:
```rust
impl Hash for TextBoxContent use (match self { Number(n) => n.impl, String(s) => s.impl });
```
Here the delegating expression can contain several branches that does not need to unify from a type perspective. The `.impl` syntax should be replaced by a call to the actual delegated method. Note that although this pattern may occur naturally with enums it can again apply to any kind of types:
```rust
impl Tr for BStruct use (if self.condition { self.field1.impl } else { self.field2.impl });
```
However this kind of delegation for value-dependent surrogate types has a limitation: it does not work for methods with multiple `Self` parameters. Indeed there is no guarantee the runtime values for different parameters will select the same branch and then define a consistent surrogate.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

* It creates some implicit code reuse. This is an intended feature but it could also be considered as dangerous. Modifying traits and surrogate types may automatically import new methods in delegating types with no compiler warning even in cases it is not appropriate (but this issue is the same as modifying a superclass in OOP).
* The benefit may be considered limited for one-method traits.

# Alternatives

## OOP inheritance

As mentioned before, inheritance can handle similar cases with the advantage its concepts and mechanisms are well known. But with some drawbacks:
* Multiple inheritance is possible but to my knowledge no serious proposition has been made for Rust and I doubt anyone wants to end up with a system as complex and tricky as C++ inheritance (whereas delegation is **naturally multiple delegation**)
* As said before inheritance mixes orthogonal concepts (code reuse and subtyping) and does not allow fine grain control over which part of the superclass interface is inherited.

## Multiple derefs

Some people noticed a similarity with trait `Deref`. A main limitation is that you can only deref to a single type. However one could imagine implementing multiple derefs by providing the target type as a generic parameter (`Deref<A>`) rather than as an associated type. But again you can find limitations:
* As for inheritance visibility control is impossible: if `B` can be derefed to `A` then the entire public interface of `A` is accessible.
* `Deref` only offers a superficial similarity. If `A` implements trait `Tr`, instances of `B` can sometimes be used where `Tr` is expected but as a counter example a `&[B]` slice is not assignable to `fn f(t: &[T]) where T : Tr`. Derefs do not interact nicely with bounded generic parameters.

## Compiler plugin

I was suggested to write a compiler plugin. But I was also told that [type information is not accessible][type_information] (unless you can annotate the delegated trait yourself, which implies you must own it). Moreover I'm not sure a plugin could easily solve the partial delegation cases.

## Do nothing

In the end, it is a syntactic sugar. It just improves the ease of expression, not the capacity to express more concepts. Some simple cases may be handled with deref, others with trait default methods.

One of my concerns is that the arrival of inheritance in Rust may encourage bad habits. Developers are lazy and DRY principle dissuades them from writing repetitive code. The temptation may be strong to overuse inheritance in situations where only code reuse is required (resulting in unnecessary subtyping hierarchy and uncontrolled interface exposure).

# Unresolved questions

The exact syntax is to be discussed. The proposed one is short but does not name the surrogate type explicitly which may hurt readability.
